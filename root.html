      <ul>
        <li>Player with the Three of Spades starts first!</li>
        <li>The first play of the game must be a valid combination that includes the Three of Spades</li>
        <li>Valid combinations are consecutive sequences of 3+ cards, four-of-a-kinds, three-of-a-kinds, pairs, and single cards</li>
        <li>Play continues in clockwise direction</li>
        <li>All players must beat the previous combo by playing a similar type of combo that is higher in value</li>
        <li>Threes are the lowest in value and Twos are the highest in value</li>
        <li>In case of a tiebreaker, the stronger suit wins</li>
        <li>Hearts are the highest in rank, followed by Diamonds, Clubs and Spades</li>
        <li>When there are no playable cards, the player must pass and wait until the next round to start</li>
        <li>When all but one player passes, that player gets to start the next round with any combination</li>
        <li>First one to play all of their cards wins!</li>
